# ROS HelloWorld
This is a super-minimal example to show how to create a ROS activity and launch ROSJava nodes.

## Build and test instructions
The app can be built and installed to an Android device by importing the project in Android Studio, and using its `Run` button.
Once installed, start the app, and connect to a ROS master running in your network (Wi-Fi has to be enabled in the phone).

Finally, see `/chatter` and `/rosout` topics to check the output.
